# gia-xtractor-img-v1
## --@STCGoal workspace /new python program using openai (or google cloud platform), search or what is required to extract a set of abstract images matching an input images. project name: 'gia-xtractor-img-v1'

## --@STCIssue NOT WORKING too Complex I guess

This project is designed to extract a set of abstract images matching an input image. It utilizes Python and various image processing techniques to achieve this goal.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
gia-xtractor-img-v1
├── src
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── image_processing
│   │   └── image_extractor.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   └── helper_functions.py
│   └── tests
│       └── test_image_extractor.py
├── input_images
├── extracted_images
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

The purpose of each file and directory is as follows:

- `src/main.py`: This file serves as the entry point of the Python program. It contains the main logic for extracting a set of abstract images matching an input image.

- `src/image_processing/image_extractor.py`: This file contains the `ImageExtractor` class, which is responsible for extracting abstract images. It may include methods such as `extract_images` to perform the extraction process.

- `src/utils/helper_functions.py`: This file contains helper functions that can be used throughout the project. It may include functions for image processing, file handling, or any other utility functions required by the program.

- `src/tests/test_image_extractor.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `ImageExtractor` class. It may include test cases to verify the functionality of the image extraction process.

- `input_images/`: This directory is used to store the input images that will be used as a reference for extracting abstract images.

- `extracted_images/`: This directory is used to store the extracted abstract images.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required for the project. It may include packages such as OpenAI or Google Cloud Platform libraries that are needed for image processing or any other dependencies specific to the project.

Please note that the specific libraries or APIs from OpenAI or Google Cloud Platform that are required for the image extraction process will need to be installed and configured separately. The project structure provided here focuses on the code organization and does not include specific configurations for these services.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Place the input images in the `input_images/` directory.

3. Run the `main.py` script located in the `src/` directory. This script will extract abstract images matching the input images and save them in the `extracted_images/` directory.

4. The extracted abstract images can be found in the `extracted_images/` directory.
